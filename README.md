Photography is a way of feeling, touching, and loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever. 
It remembers the little things, long after you have forgotten everything. Create a photographic site with the following requirements:
   ~ Add a list of your favorite photos.
   ~ Write a short biography of the Website.
   ~ Make the page as visually appealing as you can with the knowledge you have learned so far.
   ~ The project must be designed before it is being worked on.
   ~ The design must be attached to the website for reviews
